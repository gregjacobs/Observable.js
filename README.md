Observable.js
=============

Class for implementing events in your JS objects. This is basically the implementation from the MIT licensed
Ext Core, all wrapped into one class along with its dependencies, making it available as a separate utility for 
inclusion into multiple projects.

The Observable class is intended to be the base class of any class which fires events.
